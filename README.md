### HTML Framework
OH CRM has been initially developed using Bootstrap. An issue is open for experimenting with different frameworks. Motivation for this exploration is to reduce the size of the framework for improved browser performance and to provide a more skeletal framework on which custom stylesheets can provide a leaner custom CSS scheme.
